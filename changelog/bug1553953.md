The `workerType` identifier now has a more restrictive pattern:
 * consisting of lower-case alphanumeric plus dash (`-`)
 * from 1 to 38 characters long
 * beginning with a lower-case alphabetic character
 * ending with a lower-case alphanumeric character (not a dash)
Any worker types not matching this pattern will no longer function as of this version.

This is considered a minor change because no known workerTypes (aside from some
internal testing workerTypes) violate this pattern.
